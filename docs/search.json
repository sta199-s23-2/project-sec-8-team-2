Building off the Forbes World’s Billionaires lists from 1996-2014, scholars at Peterson Institute for International Economics have added a couple dozen more variables about each billionaire - including whether they were self-made or inherited their wealth. (Roughly half of European billionaires and one-third of U.S. billionaires got a significant financial boost from family, the authors estimate.)” - Overview located on CORGIS data set original site.\nThis publication was cited as the origin of the data:http://www.iie.com/publications/interstitial.cfm?ResearchID=2917\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nThis data set compiles a list of billionaires from around the globe from 1996 until 2016. It ranks them from most to least wealthy, it tells us when the data of each billionaire was collected, their age, their net worth, whether this money was inherited, and more.\nPotential ethical concerns.\nGenerally, it is best practice for data to be collected voluntarily, and it is possible that this data was collected involuntarily without the subjects’ consent. This data set also contains a lot of personal identifying information about individuals, which may conflict for practices of de-identifying subjects and preserving subjects’ anonymity."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\nWe would like to explore the correlation between inheritance and current net worth. For this, we would ask…\nDoes receiving an inheritance impact the total net worth of each billionaire? Does birth place/country of citizenship have an impact on inheritance or net worth? Does wealth type impact net worth? Ultimately, did inheritance “create” the majority of the wealthiest billionaires in the world?\nStatement of why this question is important.\nTo an extent, wealth impacts quality of life; thus, many people aspire for wealth with the hope of building a good life for themselves. The “bootstraps” theory asserts that anyone who works hard and “pulls themselves up by their bootstraps” can succeed and become wealthy. However, wealth is inextricably intertwined with factors including privilege, class, race, gender, etc., and exploring this research question is critical to helping us better understand the nature of wealth-building.\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nWe are interested in researching the correlation between inheritance and the net worth of the billionaires listed in this data set. Specifically, we would like to investigate whether inheritance played a key role in creating the world’s richest people. We believe this to be true and that the majority of billionaires had help from an inheritance to build their current net worth.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThe subsequent variables will be considered in our analysis of the billionaires data set. Their variable types are as follows:\nName (nominal categorical)\nRank (discrete numeric)\nLocation.Citizenship (nominal categorical)\nWealth.Type (nominal categorical)\nWealth.How.Inherited (nominal categorical)\nWealth.Worth in Billions (continuous numeric)"
