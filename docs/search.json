It discusses how social and historical forces such as the Civil Right Movement could shape the political identity of regions significantly, and also geographical factors such as climate, terrain, and resource availability could potentially influence people’s values and beliefs. For example, people who live in areas with harsh climates may prioritize self-sufficiency and individualism.
