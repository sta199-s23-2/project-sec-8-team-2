    "text": "To the average person, the modern billionaire is at once mysterious and completely scrutable. Few will ever come face to face with a billionaire, yet many can name the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates and a fact or two about each. While these billionaires sit on enormous wealth, 47% of the world lives on less than $6.85 per day, and 84% lives on less than $30 per day [1]. Moreover, the past two decades have seen a steep increase in global inequality as the world’s billionaires have captured an increasing proportion of global wealth [2]. Our realities of poverty among wealth and stark inequality thus incite questions about how world leaders should engage with billionaire wealth - was this wealth justly acquired? What are the ethics of wealth re-distribution? Wealth accumulation also invites larger philosophical questions of how society values or devalues certain activities over others.\nGiven these considerations, in this report, we investigate the potential sources of billionaire wealth. Specifically, we assess the question of how do wealth category, citizenship, and wealth type relate to billionaire net worths in 2014?\nWe hypothesize that financial wealth, European citizenship, and inheritance are related to billionaires having higher net worths. To begin with, our team hypothesizes that financial wealth relates to billionaires with higher net worths given that banking and finance have served the largest primary industries for up to 20.4% of the total billionaire population, according to the Billionaire Census 2022 [4]. Primary industries suggest where the billionaires devoted most of their time and by which they created most of their wealth. Second, we hypothesize that inheritance also associates with higher net worths of billionaires due to the link between increased inheritance flows and increased wealth distribution identified by several studies [5]. Finally, we associate European citizenship with higher net worths of billionaires as the third component of the hypothesis, as Europe’s billionaire wealth has been growing the fastest, up 22% year-over-year in 2021 [6].\nOur data comes from the “billionaires” data set, which we obtained from the CORGIS Dataset Project. This data set was created by Ryan Whitcomb in 2016 and originally sourced from a report by Caroline Freund and Sarah Oliver of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Freund and Oliver derived their data set from Forbes World’s Billionaires lists from 1996-2014 [3]. Forbes journalists drew from shareholder information, company financial statements, current exchange rates, and meetings with candidates to estimate billionaire net worths. From 1996-2010, the Forbes data included name, rank, citizenship, and net worth. Then, in 2011, Forbes added the source of wealth (company or sector).\nFreund and Oliver supplemented the Forbes data with additional variables that describe the characteristics of billionaires and their businesses. The “billionaires” data set includes information on billionaires taken at three-time points: 1996, 2001, and 2014.\nThis report focuses on four variables: wealth, wealth type, wealth category, and citizenship. Following is a brief description of each variable of interest:\n\nWealth - Called “wealth.worth.in.billions” in the data set. A continuous numeric variable that describes the wealth in billions for each observation, where one observation is one billionaire at one time point.\nWealth type - Called “wealth.type” in the data set. A nominal categorical variable that describes the type of wealth. For billionaires in 2014, there are four wealth types: founder, inherited, privatized, and self-made.\nWealth category - Called “wealth.how.category” in the data set. A nominal categorical variable that describes the category of wealth. For billionaires in 2014, there are six wealth categories: energy, financial, new, non-traded, resource, and traded.\nCitizenship - Called “location.citizenship” in the data set. A nominal categorical variable that describes the country of citizenship of the billionaire. In this report, we group citizenship into Europe and Not Europe.\n\nThe method by which information for this data set was collected priimarily raises two ethical concerns. First, when data collection involves human subjects, it is best practice to obtain the subjects’ consent. Although the Forbes journalists conducted interviews with subjects, it is unclear whether the journalists obtained the consent of all the billionaires that they collected data on. Moreover, it is unclear whether how Forbes obtained shareholder information and company financial statements. Second, this data set contains extensive personal identifying information about individuals, which may conflict for practices of de-identifying subjects and preserving subjects’ anonymity."

Moreover, it allows us to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. If the results of the linear regression analysis show a significant relationship between financial wealth, European citizenship, and inheritance and higher net worths of billionaires, then the data would support the hypothesis."

However, one per data set is required.)\nWe would like to explore the correlation between inheritance and current net worth. For this, we would ask…\nDoes receiving an inheritance impact the total net worth of each billionaire? Does birth place/country of citizenship have an impact on inheritance or net worth? Does wealth type impact net worth? Ultimately, did inheritance “create” the majority of the wealthiest billionaires in the world?\nRevised research question (03/21/2023): How do wealth category, citizenship, and wealth type related to billionaire net worths in 2014?\nStatement of why this question is important.\nTo an extent, wealth impacts quality of life; thus, many people aspire for wealth with the hope of building a good life for themselves. The “bootstraps” theory asserts that anyone who works hard and “pulls themselves up by their bootstraps” can succeed and become wealthy. However, wealth is inextricably intertwined with factors including privilege, class, race, gender, etc., and exploring this research question is critical to helping us better understand the nature of wealth-building.\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nWe are interested in researching the relationship between different factors and the net worth of the billionaires listed in this data set. Specifically, we would like to investigate whether inheritance, wealth category, and citizenship played a key role in creating the world’s richest people. We hypothesize that financial wealth, European citizenship, and inheritance are related to billionaires having higher net worths.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

However, over time, various regions’ political leanings may shift. In light of increasingly political polarization in the US, it is critical for us to reexamine the current political state of the nation.\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nFor this research topic we will be examining the varying presidential preferences of voters in different geographic regions of the US.

PLOS ONE, 12(2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171497\n\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\n\nThe article “The Political Reference Point: How Geography Shapes Political Identity” provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between geography and political identity, highlighting the importance of considering the influence of regions on individual’s party affiliation and voting preference. It discusses how social and historical forces such as the Civil Rights Movement could shape the political identity of regions significantly, and also how geographical factors such as climate, terrain, and resource availability could potentially influence people’s values and beliefs. For example, people who live in areas with harsh climates may prioritize self-sufficiency and individualism. Hence, the political “blueness” or “redness” of people’s locations also influence their voting preferences, exemplified in the presidential elections.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur team’s research question aims to investigate how the relationship between geography and the voting preference exemplified in the 2016 Presidential Election, building on the hypothesis and the conclusion from the journal article. Specifically, we divide the regions to Northeast, South, West, Midwest, and investigate the influence of the regions on the voters’ preference towards Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton."
